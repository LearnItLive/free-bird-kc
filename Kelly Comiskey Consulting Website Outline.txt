Kelly Comiskey Consulting Website OutlineTheme and Layout RecommendationsThe Folex Lite Astro theme is a suitable choice for this site. It offers a clean, professional design tailored to agencies/consultants and includes essentials like a responsive homepage and built-in contact form integration[1]. This theme’s minimal, modern layout will highlight Kelly’s content without clutter. (If a more personal portfolio style is preferred, alternatives like a free Astro portfolio theme could be considered, but they may require adding sections for testimonials and pricing manually. Folex Lite provides a solid out-of-the-box structure for a consulting business.)Proposed Site Structure* Home: Hero section with a tagline and brief overview of Kelly’s value proposition, plus a prominent call-to-action.* About Kelly: Background of Kelly Comiskey – her experience, credentials, and what sets her apart (international experience, finance/law/tech background, etc.).* Services: A summary of consulting services offered (e.g. fractional executive support, operations consulting, recruiting strategy, personal assistance), each with a short description.* Pricing: Outline of the subscription-based monthly retainer model and how task-based billing works.* Testimonials: Quotes from satisfied clients (placeholder testimonials from ~5 people) to build credibility.* Contact: Contact form and details for reaching out (email and/or phone), plus a closing call-to-action to encourage inquiries.(Each of the sections above could be implemented as separate pages or as scrollable sections on a single-page site, depending on the chosen Astro theme’s capabilities. Below is the suggested copy for each section, written in a polished yet personal tone.)Home Page (Hero Section)Headline (H1): Fractional Executive Support & Operations ExcellenceSubheading: Empowering leaders with high-level executive assistance, operational savvy, and global experience across finance, law, and tech.Introduction (blurb):Hi, I’m Kelly Comiskey. I partner with busy executives and growing companies to streamline operations, refine strategies, and handle critical tasks with precision. With over 15 years of experience supporting C-suite leaders around the world, I understand the demands of executive life and how to make things run smoothly. My mission is to free up your time and mental space so you can focus on what you do best – leading your business.Suggested imagery: A professional hero image that conveys global business and efficiency – for example, a sleek office skyline or an abstract world map background – with an overlay of Kelly’s tagline. If available, a subtle photo of Kelly working with a client (or a confident portrait) could be integrated to personalize the hero section.Call-To-Action:A clear call-to-action button labeled “Get in Touch” or “Schedule a Consultation” should be prominently displayed, encouraging visitors to reach out for an initial discussion.About KellyKelly Comiskey is a seasoned executive support and operations professional with a passion for helping leaders and organizations thrive. She has international experience and a proven track record across multiple industries. For four years, Kelly served as the right hand to the Chief Human Resources Officer at Citadel, one of the largest U.S. financial firms[2]. She then spent two years in operations and HR at Kirkland & Ellis, the world’s largest law firm[3]. In these roles, she not only managed day-to-day executive needs but also drove recruiting initiatives and special projects at the highest levels of corporate operations.Beyond her corporate tenure, Kelly has an academic and global background that is unique in the field. She even taught international law in France as a professor at Université de Lyon II[4] – a role that honed her cross-cultural communication skills. Kelly holds an LL.M. (Master of Laws) in International Law from the University of Lyon II in France[5] and is a Fulbright Scholar[6]. Her educational journey (including graduating top of her class in both her master’s and undergraduate programs) and time living in Europe and Asia have made her multilingual and highly adaptable to different cultural and business environments.With this rich blend of experience and credentials, Kelly brings a global perspective, rigorous work ethic, and trusted expertise to her clients. She is known for being proactive, discreet, and extremely detail-oriented – the person that top executives trust for their most sensitive projects and day-to-day management. Now, as an independent consultant, Kelly offers that same level of high-caliber support to a select portfolio of clients. When you work with Kelly, you gain a fractional Chief of Staff and operations partner who is 100% committed to your success.Suggested imagery: A professional portrait of Kelly, smiling and confident, can be featured here to put a face to the name (ideally a high-quality headshot or a photo of her in a professional setting). This personal touch helps build trust. In addition, a world map or flags could be subtly included (e.g. in the background or alongside the text) to emphasize her international experience, or logos of notable firms (Citadel, Kirkland & Ellis) she’s been associated with could be listed for credibility (if usage rights/permissions allow).ServicesKelly provides flexible fractional support and consulting services tailored to the needs of executives, entrepreneurs, and organizations. Her offerings cover a range of executive support, operations management, and talent strategy needs. Below are the core service areas:* Fractional Executive Support: High-level executive assistant services for leaders who need top-notch support without a full-time hire. This includes managing calendars and emails, coordinating complex travel and meetings, preparing meeting agendas and briefs, handling correspondence, and serving as a trusted “right hand” for day-to-day executive tasks. Kelly excels at anticipating needs and ensuring busy executives stay organized and focused.* Operations Consulting: Analysis and improvement of business operations and workflows. Kelly can dive into your organizational processes to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, then implement solutions (like better SOPs, project management systems, or communication protocols). Whether it’s coordinating between departments, improving administrative systems, or planning for scale, she provides the strategic insight and hands-on help to streamline operations.* Recruiting Strategy & Execution: End-to-end recruitment support to build your team with the right talent. Drawing on her background in corporate recruiting, Kelly can assist with developing job descriptions, sourcing and screening candidates, and structuring interview processes. She has experience hiring for finance, law, and tech roles, and understands how to attract high-caliber candidates. From defining a talent strategy to the final offer negotiations, she ensures your hiring process is efficient and candidate-friendly.* High-Level & Sensitive Personal Assistance: Discreet personal support for executives and high-net-worth individuals. Kelly is adept at handling confidential and sensitive tasks such as managing personal schedules, coordinating private travel or events, overseeing household or family logistics, and serving as a liaison for personal matters (legal, financial, or otherwise). With utmost respect for privacy, she takes care of the critical personal details that enable leaders to stay focused on their professional responsibilities, knowing their private matters are in trusted hands.Each service can be engaged on a fractional (part-time or as-needed) basis, which means you get the benefit of Kelly’s expertise exactly when and how you need it. Whether you require a few hours of support each week or a dedicated partner during a critical project, services are flexible to fit your situation.Suggested imagery: Consider using a set of four icons or illustrations to represent each service category for quick visual impact. For example, an icon of a calendar or checklist for Executive Support, cogwheels or a flowchart for Operations Consulting, a magnifying glass or organizational chart for Recruiting, and a shield or key for Sensitive Assistance (to denote confidentiality). These icons can accompany each service title. Alternatively, small relevant photos (e.g., a person organizing a calendar, a team meeting for operations, a handshake with a new hire for recruiting, and a private jet or sealed envelope for personal assistance) could be used, but simple icons might keep the design clean and modern.PricingWe offer a subscription-based, monthly retainer model to provide maximum value and flexibility. This approach ensures that you have dedicated access to Kelly’s support every month, with the freedom to adjust as your needs evolve. Here’s how the pricing and engagement model works:* Monthly Retainer: Clients pay a flat monthly fee to reserve a set amount of Kelly’s time and expertise each month. This retainer guarantees priority attention to your ongoing needs – essentially making Kelly an extension of your team on a part-time basis. (For example, a client might subscribe to 20 hours of support per month, usable across any of the services above.)* Task-Based Billing: Any significant project or task outside the scope of the retainer can be billed separately on a per-item or hourly basis. This means if you have a special project one month (such as organizing a multi-day executive retreat or a major hiring push) that exceeds the retainer’s included hours, it can be scoped and billed as an add-on. You’ll always know in advance if something falls outside the retainer.* Customized Plans: Kelly will work with you to tailor the retainer level and services to fit your requirements. Need more support one month and less the next? Plans can scale up or down with proper notice. The goal is a flexible partnership that delivers the help you need without the commitment of a full-time hire.* Transparent Reporting: Clients receive clear reports of how time is used and tasks accomplished, so you can see the ROI of the services. There are no surprise fees – every task and project is tracked.Note: While specific pricing numbers depend on the scope and complexity of your needs, a consultation can quickly determine the appropriate monthly retainer tier. Please contact Kelly for a custom quote. The retainer model is designed to be cost-effective compared to hiring a full-time executive assistant or operations manager, while providing you with high-level expertise on demand.Suggested imagery: A simple pricing table or plan cards could be displayed here for visual clarity (e.g., “Retainer Plan” and “Additional Projects” columns). Using a relevant graphic like a calendar with a dollar sign, or an infographic icon for a subscription, can help illustrate the concept of a monthly retainer. Keep the design clean – the focus should be on clarity.Client TestimonialsNothing speaks louder than the words of satisfied clients. Here are a few testimonials from executives and professionals who have worked with Kelly. (These are placeholder testimonials; real client quotes should be used when available.)* “Kelly has transformed the way I manage my day. Since she started supporting me, I’ve gained back hours in my week to focus on high-level strategy. Her attention to detail and proactive approach are second to none.” – Jane D., COO of a FinTech Company* “I was initially unsure about a remote fractional assistant, but Kelly proved that it can work seamlessly. She quickly understood our law firm’s culture and has improved our operations efficiency within months. I trust her with sensitive matters without hesitation.” – Mark R., Partner at a Global Law Firm* “The recruiting support we received from Kelly was outstanding. She helped us craft better job postings, find amazing candidates, and even sat in on interviews to assess cultural fit. We ended up with three stellar new hires. Kelly’s expertise saved us so much time.” – Lisa S., HR Director at a Tech Startup* “As a first-time founder, I struggled with wearing too many hats. Bringing Kelly on board in a fractional capacity was one of the best decisions I made. She organized our operations, set up processes, and even handled my investor communications flawlessly. It feels like I have a COO on call.” – Alex B., Founder of an E-commerce Company* “I rely on Kelly for both professional and personal projects – from coordinating executive board meetings to planning a family event abroad. She handles everything with grace and efficiency. The peace of mind I get from her support is priceless.” – Samantha T., CEO & PhilanthropistEach of these testimonials highlights a different facet of Kelly’s services (from day-to-day efficiency to operations consulting, recruiting, and personal assistance) to give prospective clients a well-rounded picture of the value she provides.Suggested imagery: If possible, include a small headshot or avatar for each testimonial to humanize them (stock photos or silhouette icons can be used as placeholders if real photos are not available). Alternatively, stylized quote icons and a nice layout can make this section visually appealing. For example, each quote could be in a speech bubble or italicized text, with the client’s name and role beneath it. Ensuring this section stands out (perhaps with a subtle background color or graphic) will draw visitors’ attention to these powerful word-of-mouth endorsements.ContactThe final section of the site should make it easy to get in touch with Kelly. This is where interested visitors can start the conversation about working together. Include a short inviting message and multiple contact options:Contact Message:Ready to elevate your operations and take tasks off your plate? I’d love to discuss how I can help. Feel free to reach out and let’s schedule a time to talk. Whether you have a specific project in mind or just want to learn more about how fractional support works, I’m here to answer your questions.Contact Options:- Contact Form: A simple form with fields for Name, Email, Phone (optional), and Message. This allows visitors to send a direct message through the website. (Ensure the form is integrated with email or a CRM so Kelly gets notified quickly.)- Email: For those who prefer email, provide a direct email address. For example: kellycomiskey@gmail.com (or a professional email like contact@kellycomiskey.com if set up). Encourage users to email anytime.- Phone: If Kelly is open to being contacted by phone or text, list a business phone number here. Otherwise, this can be omitted or replaced with a note about scheduling a call after initial contact.- LinkedIn: Given Kelly’s professional audience, it could be useful to include a link to her LinkedIn profile for credibility. A small LinkedIn icon linking to her profile (since it was provided) lets visitors connect or verify her background easily.Call-to-Action: Reinforce a final call-to-action such as: “Let’s talk about how I can support you. Contact me today for a free initial consultation.” This encourages immediate action and offers an incentive (the free consultation).Suggested imagery: This section can include a friendly photo of Kelly “in action” (e.g., on the phone or in a meeting) to personalize the appeal to contact. Alternatively, use a simple graphic like an envelope icon (for email) or phone icon next to the contact info. A map pinpoint icon could also be used if you wish to indicate location (e.g., “Based in Chicago, IL – Serving clients globally”). Keep the design clean and ensure the contact form stands out with a contrasting button (e.g., “Submit” or “Send Message”).Conclusion: By structuring the site with the sections above, visitors will quickly learn who Kelly is, what she offers, and how to engage her services. The tone throughout should remain professional yet personal – reflecting Kelly’s high-level expertise as well as her approachable, client-focused attitude. With clear calls to action and easy navigation, the website will effectively convert interested visitors into leads, showcasing Kelly Comiskey’s strengths as an executive support and operations consultant.[1] Folex Lite – Digital Agency Theme | Astrohttps://astro.build/themes/details/folex-lite-digital-agency-theme/[2] [3] [4] Learn It Live | Chicago, IL, US Startup https://gust.com/companies/learn_it_live_2[5] [6] Kelly Comiskey Resume 8.22.2014.docxhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/11s5BWpDweG7yXx-z8OqRc0_cM0CnmM6wIlk00QPn9Vw
