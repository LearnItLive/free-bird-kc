Kelly Comiskey is a seasoned executive support and operations professional with international experience across finance, law, and tech. For four years, Kelly served as the right hand to the Chief Human Resources Officer at Citadel, one of the largest U.S. financial firms. She then spent two years in operations and HR at Kirkland & Ellis, the world’s largest law firm. In these roles, she not only managed day‑to‑day executive needs but also drove recruiting initiatives and special projects at the highest levels of corporate operations.

Beyond her corporate tenure, Kelly taught international law in France as a professor at Université de Lyon II—a role that honed her cross‑cultural communication skills. Kelly holds an LL.M. (Master of Laws) in International Law from the University of Lyon II in France and is a Fulbright Scholar. Her educational journey (including graduating top of her class in both her master’s and undergraduate programs) and time living in Europe and Asia have made her multilingual and highly adaptable to different cultural and business environments.

With this blend of experience and credentials, Kelly brings a global perspective, rigorous work ethic, and trusted expertise to her clients. She is known for being proactive, discreet, and extremely detail‑oriented—the person that top executives trust for their most sensitive projects and day‑to‑day management. As an independent consultant, Kelly offers that same level of high‑caliber support to a select portfolio of clients. When you work with Kelly, you gain a fractional Chief of Staff and operations partner who is 100% committed to your success.
