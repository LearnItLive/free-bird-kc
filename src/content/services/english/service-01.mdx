I partner with executives and founders to keep priorities moving: anticipate needs, prepare decision-ready briefings, coordinate complex logistics, and shield your time so you can lead.

## Typical areas

- Calendar, email, and meeting orchestration
- Briefs, agendas, and communication support
- Travel coordination and logistics
- Confidential correspondence and followâ€‘ups
