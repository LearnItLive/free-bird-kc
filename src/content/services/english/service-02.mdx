I evaluate where processes break down, define a clear operating cadence, and implement tools and SOPs that boost clarity, speed, and accountability.

## Typical areas

- Process audits and SOP development
- Cross‑functional coordination and communication
- Asana/Notion/GSuite workflow design
- Executive reporting and dashboards
