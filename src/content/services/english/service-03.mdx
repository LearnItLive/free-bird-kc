I build an efficient funnel from JD to offer: clarity on role requirements, candidate sourcing, structured interviews, and a smooth candidate experience.

## Typical areas

- Role scoping and scorecards
- Sourcing, screening, and scheduling
- Interview panel design and training
- Offer process and references
